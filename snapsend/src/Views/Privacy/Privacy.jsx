                Flag Them was established to unite the people of the world and
                Law Enforcement with a powerful tool, to work together as one to
                eradicate crime. Utilizing the power of the internet and the
                traffic you read or hear about every day on social media
                platforms so many have come to depend on for not only
                communications with friends and family but, as the source of
                daily news, opinion, and other information once primarily
                delivered by newspapers, magazines, radio and television. Now
                Flag Them will use all that, plus the power of personal
                observation, pictures, or statements to deal a blow to the bad
                guys and keep us safe.
              </p>

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                Remember the Flag Them platform was created to collect and use
                all information posted, collected, shared in any manner on the
                web, by camera or personal statement, to help fight crime. Flag
                Them is the safe area, you may operate in to transfer needed
                information, and communications to fight crime at the same time
                shielding you from the freedom of information acts that the bad
                people use now to find out what was said and by whom.
              </p>

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                Flag Them is dedicated to creating, and maintaining, a level of
                respect and honor for your privacy that will set the bar for
                integrity for the future of the internet. Keeping all your
                interaction with Law Enforcement private and safe. Because your
                interactions are not on a public domain your identity will
                remain with you. Only Flag Them, Law Enforcement and the team
                members you work with, may have the ability to know you, and
                this is only after you have requested or been invited to join a
                team and have given them the permission to share your personal
                verification information. To work on some teams, you will be
                required to fill out more information to protect you and the
                people you are working with. To make sure team members are the
                people they say they are. Again, your personal information will
                never be sold and is only used to establish security and
                personal identification on certain national and international
                teams.

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                Respecting and honoring your privacy begins with offering you
                (the user) a clear statement regarding the kinds of information
                Flag Them collects as part of our interaction with you:
              </p>

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                First, Flag Them is based on the kind of proprietary platform
                without which no social media outlet can operate. A platform is
                a software tool used to write applications and run them. The
                platform includes software tools, compilers, class libraries,
                utilities, and everything else needed to develop the
                applications necessary to provide our service, as well as a
                runtime engine for executing the applications. Virtually nothing
                on the internet can exist without the use of a platform similar
                to ours.
              </p>

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                Flag Them, and every other social media platform in existence,
                relies on information collected as you utilize our site to fine
                tune our platform to assure we offer the best platform in the
                world for your use and the end outcome of fighting crime. If we
                did not collect that information, the site would become useless
                for the end goal. We collect and track information you put in
                files to improve our site and fight crime; we do not collect or
                track information for the purpose of selling that information to
                marketing companies. We are nearly unique in that respect; as
                you’ve read in the news, many if not most social media sites
                profit significantly through the selling of your information.
              </p>

              <p className="f16 color_black m_b_30">
                If, for any reason, our policy regarding the sale of information
                must change due to either regulatory or operational needs, you
                will be informed of the change and will be given the option to
                opt out of your participation in the Flag Them community.The
                only exception to our notification protocol would be a legally
                delivered request from law enforcement requiring us to turn over
                information as a matter of law, other legally binding legal
                actions, or a properly prepared and delivered warrant or
                membership.

              Second, robust protection of your privacy begins with YOU. Nothing anyone has ever posted to a social media outlet on the internet is ever truly private. If it can be seen on a screen, it can be copied, using three or four keystrokes, and used for the purposes, for better or worse, of whomever took the screenshot. Remember, there is nothing you put on the web, even if people say it will disappear, that can’t be captured and saved. To be safe, refrain from putting anything out there you would not want to stand behind at a later date. Make sure your information in your private groups and teams is seen by people you have vetted and trust. Do not post critical information on the open streams about team activities or files you are working on. The social media side is for just that, being social, keep all important information and file work that could compromise you, your team, your groups or the Law Enforcement you are working with, in the private areas.

              Your content as posted on Flag Them is for your use, your teams or groups use and how you share content is up to you; it’s your responsibility to decide how to share that content.
